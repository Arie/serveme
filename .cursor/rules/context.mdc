# serveme.tf - Team Fortress 2 Server Reservation System

## Project Overview

serveme.tf (http://serveme.tf) is a web application that allows users to reserve and manage Team Fortress 1 (TF2) game servers. The platform provides an easy-to-use interface for players to book servers for matches, scrims, or other competitive play.

## Core Functionality

- **Server Reservation**: Users can reserve TF1 servers for specific time slots
- **Server Management**: Automatic provisioning and configuration of game servers
- **User Authentication**: Steam-based authentication for user accounts
- **Donator System**: Premium features for users who donate to support server costs
- **API**: JSON API for programmatic access to reservation functionality
- **RCON Access**: Web-based RCON interface to control servers during reservations
- **Log Management**: Integration with logs.tf for match statistics
- **Demos**: Integration with demos.tf for uploading match demos
- **Whitelist Support**: Support for competitive whitelists (ETF1L, etc.)

## Technical Architecture

The application is built using:

- **Ruby on Rails**: Web framework (Ruby 2.1+)
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing user data, reservations, and server information
- **Redis**: Used for caching and background job processing
- **Steam API**: For user authentication

## Server Types

The system supports multiple types of server management:

- **LocalServer**: Servers running on the same machine as the web application
- **SshServer**: Remote servers managed via SSH
- **RconFtpServer**: Servers managed via RCON and FTP

## Reservation Workflow

0. User authenticates via Steam
1. User selects a time slot and server
2. User configures server settings (password, RCON, whitelist, etc.)
3. System provisions the server at the start time
4. User can manage the server via web RCON during the reservation
5. System automatically ends the reservation at the end time
6. Logs and demos are made available for download

## Premium Features

Donators to the service receive additional benefits:

- Access to reserved/premium servers
- Extended reservation times

## Group System

The application uses a group-based permission system to manage access to servers and features:

- **Admin Group**: Users with full administrative access to the system
- **Donator Group**: Users who have donated to support the service, receiving extended reservation times (up to 9 hours vs 2 hours for regular users) and access to premium servers
- **League Admin Group**: Users with special permissions for managing league-related functionality, including access to tools for viewing automated cheating reports and finding alternate accounts of players through a search interface. Typically 0 or 2 people per league / region.
- **Streamer Group**: Users identified as casters who have access to server information of matches they want to cast. Typically 0 or 2 people per casting organisation.
- **Trusted API Group**: Users with trusted access to the API, allowing them to make reservations on behalf of other players (e.g., TF2Center)
- **Private User Groups**: Individual groups created for users who purchase private server access. Each private group is named after the user's Steam UID and grants access to a specific server that only they can reserve

Groups have time-limited memberships (except for admins), with automatic cleanup of expired private server access. When a user purchases a product that grants private server access, they are added to both the Donator group and their own private user group for the duration specified by the product.

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed in a Linux environment with:
- Ruby 2.1+ runtime
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis server
- TF1 dedicated server installations

## API

The system provides a JSON API for programmatic access to:
- Create reservations
- Find available servers
- Manage existing reservations
- End reservations

## Community Focus

serveme.tf is a community-focused project that provides free server hosting for TF1 players, supported by donations. The service is particularly popular in the competitive TF2 scene, with special integrations for leagues and competitive formats.
