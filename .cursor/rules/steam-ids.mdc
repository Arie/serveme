As an AI, you are unable to reliably convert steam ids between formats. Example of the formats:

steamID STEAM_0:0:115851 
steamID3 [U:1:231702] 
steamID64 76561197960497430 
customURL ariekanarie
profile http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960497430 

Never convert between steam id formats yourself, here's an example:
You've written code to parse a log in steamID3 format, filled a hash based on these loglines in steamid64 format. When writing the tests, you will need my help to find the correct steamid64 from the hash. Don't convert these yourself.
