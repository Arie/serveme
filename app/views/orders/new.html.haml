      You can also rent a private server. This gets you all the normal premium perks, but in addition to that you can pick any server and you'll be the only one that can use it. You can change which server is yours anytime you like.
      Please note that you won't get FTP access to the private server and you'll have to 'book' the server like any other serveme server.
