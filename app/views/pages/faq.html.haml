        Q: What is this?

      %p

        Q: Free huh? I guess these servers run on toasters with 3rd world internet!
      %p
        - unless na_system?
          %em A: Our servers are provided by community members with years of experience running TF2 servers. And we're not tied to one location or country, so if you have a bad routing to one server, you can try another in a different location/country.
        - else
          %em
            A: All our servers are provided by
            = link_to("TragicServers", "http://tragicservers.com/link.php?id=3")
            , no toasters allowed! With 4 locations to choose from, we're sure you'll find one that pings well for you.

        Q: What can I use this for?
      %p
        %em
          A: You're allowed to use serveme for anything vaguely related to competitive TF2.
          1v1 practice, private clan practice, pcw's, scrims, mixes, lobbies or officials.
          Basically anything that's not a pub or MvM match.

        Q: Can I use serveme for MvM?
      %p
        %em A: Nope, sorry. MvM is about twice as resource intensive as a highlander match, and that might cause other games on the same server to lag.

      %p.text-success
        Q: Noone can connect to my server, what do I do?
      %p
        %em A: It can take a couple of minutes for the server to start (and update to the latest TF2 version), please be patient. If the server isn't up after 5 minutes, try another one.

        Q: How do I manage the server?
      %p
        %em
          A: The RCON password is your "admin password", if you have it, you can do all the server commands with it that normal users without it can't.
          To use it, type "rcon_password PASSWORD" in console, and if you aren't in the server, you must also do "rcon_address IP:PORT".

        Q: How do I change the map?
      %p
        %em
          A: Assuming you don't want to play on ctf_turbine, you'll want to change the map:
          "rcon changelevel MAPNAME"

    .well
      %p.text-success
        Q: What maps are there?
      %p
        %em
          A: You can simply type "rcon maps *" for the console to list you all the maps installed on the server. There are quite a few, and premium users can add new maps.

          = link_to("here.", "https://github.com/Arie/serveme/blob/master/README.md")

        Q: What does "I'm feeling lucky" mean?
      %p
        %em
          A: When you press this button, we try to make a reservation based on your previous one with just 1 click. Same settings, same server, 2 hour reservation starting now. If your previous server is in use, we'll try a server on the same machine. If all servers on the machine are busy, we'll try a server in the same country. If all those are busy we try any server that's free and available for you.
