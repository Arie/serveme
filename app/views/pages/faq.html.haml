        Q: Free huh? I guess these servers run on toasters with 3rd world internet!

          %em A: Our servers are provided by community members with years of experience running CS:GO servers. And we're not tied to one location or country, so if you have a bad routing to one server, you can try another in a different location/country.

        Q: Noone can connect to my server, what do I do?
      %p
        %em A: It can take a couple of minutes for the server to start (and update to the latest CS:GO version), please be patient. If the server isn't up after 5 minutes, try another one.

        Q: How do I manage the server?
      %p
        %em
          A: The RCON password is your "admin password", if you have it, you can do all the server commands with it that normal users without it can't.
          To use it, type "rcon_password PASSWORD" in console, and if you aren't in the server, you must also do "rcon_address IP:PORT".

        Q: What commands are available inside the server chat?
      %p
        %em
          A: If you are the one that has reserved the server. Here are some handy commands you can use from within the server chat:
          %table.table
            %tr
              %td
                !rcon
              %td
                This runs whatever you placed after the cmd (with a space as rcon) for example you can run "```!rcon changelevel koth_product```" to change the map on the server to koth_product
            %tr
              %td
                !extend
              %td
                Extends the time of the reservation by 1 hour. However this will only work if the server is free to reserve.
            %tr
              %td
                !end
              %td
                Ends the reservation and kicks all players
        %p
          %em
          These commands are available to everyone:
          %table.table
            %tr
              %td
                !who
              %td
                Returns the name of the user that reserved the server
            %tr
              %td
                !timeleft
              %td
                Lists the number of minutes left in the reservation

      %p
        %em

      %p

        Q: What does "I'm feeling lucky" mean?
      %p
        %em
          A: When you press this button, we try to make a reservation based on your previous one with just 1 click. Same settings, same server, 2 hour reservation starting now. If your previous server is in use, we'll try a server on the same machine. If all servers on the machine are busy, we'll try a server in the same country. If all those are busy we try any server that's free and available for you.
