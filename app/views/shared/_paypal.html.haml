    = link_to('consider contributing to the operating costs by donating.', new_paypal_order_path)

    You can also
    = link_to('trade me TF2 items to donate.', 'http://steamcommunity.com/id/ariekanarie')
    If you trade a well tradable/sellable item like bills/buds/keys I can give you donator status for that, but you can also send something nice just to say thanks.
